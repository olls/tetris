tetris
======

A simple Python terminal random implementation of Tetris. This is dependent on my terminal [graphics](https://github.com/olls/graphics) module.

- `console.py`: Finds the width and height of the terminal, might not work in all environments, came from StackOverflow.
- `letters.py`: A module to convert a string to large ASCII art style text.
