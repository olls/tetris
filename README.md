tetris
======

A simple Python terminal implementation of Tetris.

- `console.py`: Finds the width and height of the terminal, might not work in all environments, came from StackOverflow.
- `letters.py`: A module to convert a string to large ASCII art style text.
- `graphics.py`: The first iteration of my text based graphics engine, current [development version](http://github.com/olls/graphics) (almost unrecognizable!)
